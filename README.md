## Project Title

Sidequest week 5

## Authors

Allison Kalist (original code taken from Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han example 4 from week 5)

## Description

This code was updated from week 5 - example 4 to change the colours of the background, obstacles, player, and walls. I added walls in so the player would be able to better visualize where the world borders are. I also added a camera shake so that the player feels a sense of "fear" or anxiety when moving around.
